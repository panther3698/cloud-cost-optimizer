# README.md for Data Ingestion Module

# Data Ingestion Module

The Data Ingestion module is a critical component of the cloud cost optimization platform. It is responsible for collecting and processing data from various cloud service providers, enabling the platform to analyze and optimize cloud spending effectively.

## Overview

This module is designed to handle data ingestion from multiple sources, including Azure and AWS. It ensures that data is collected in a structured manner, allowing for seamless integration with other modules of the platform.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Data Collection**: Gather data from various cloud services, including usage metrics, billing information, and resource configurations.
- **Data Processing**: Transform and normalize the collected data to ensure consistency and usability across the platform.
- **Integration**: Provide a unified interface for other modules to access the ingested data, facilitating analysis and reporting.

## Architecture

The Data Ingestion module is structured to support multiple cloud providers, with dedicated sub-modules for Azure and AWS. Each sub-module is responsible for the specific configurations and processes required to collect data from its respective cloud environment.

For detailed information on the ingestion processes for Azure and AWS, please refer to the respective README files in the `azure` and `aws` directories.

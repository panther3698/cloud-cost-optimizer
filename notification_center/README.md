# Notification Center Module

The Notification Center module is responsible for managing notifications within the cloud cost optimization platform. It handles the generation, formatting, and delivery of notifications to users based on specific events or triggers within the system.

## Key Features

- **Notification Generation**: Automatically generates notifications based on predefined events, such as cost thresholds being exceeded or resource usage anomalies.
- **Delivery Mechanisms**: Supports multiple delivery methods, including email, SMS, and in-app notifications, ensuring users receive timely updates.
- **User Preferences**: Allows users to customize their notification preferences, including the types of notifications they wish to receive and their preferred delivery methods.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other modules, such as the rule engine and auto-remediate, to provide contextual notifications related to cost optimization actions.

## Usage

To utilize the Notification Center, ensure that it is properly configured within the platform. This includes setting up the necessary credentials for delivery services and defining the events that should trigger notifications.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a dashboard for users to view their notification history.
- Enhance the notification formatting options to include rich media.
- Explore machine learning techniques to predict and notify users of potential cost overruns before they occur.

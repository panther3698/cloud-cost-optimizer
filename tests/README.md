# Testing Module Overview

The `tests` module is dedicated to ensuring the reliability and correctness of the cloud cost optimization platform. This module encompasses various testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to validate the functionality of each component within the platform.

## Key Features

- **Testing Strategy**: This section outlines the overall approach to testing, including the types of tests implemented and their purposes.
  
- **Running Tests**: Instructions on how to execute the tests locally or in a CI/CD pipeline, including any necessary setup or dependencies.

- **Test Coverage**: A summary of the coverage provided by the tests, highlighting which modules and functionalities are tested.

- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for writing and maintaining tests to ensure high quality and maintainability of the codebase.

By maintaining a robust testing framework, we can confidently deploy updates and new features while minimizing the risk of introducing bugs or regressions.

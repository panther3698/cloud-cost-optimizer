# Auto Remediate Module

The Auto Remediate module is designed to automatically identify and resolve issues related to cloud resource usage and costs. This module leverages predefined rules and machine learning algorithms to monitor cloud environments continuously, ensuring that resources are optimized and unnecessary expenses are minimized.

## Key Features

- **Automated Issue Detection**: The module continuously monitors cloud resources for anomalies and inefficiencies.
- **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Upon detecting an issue, the module can automatically take corrective actions to remediate the problem without human intervention.
- **Integration with Rule Engine**: Works in conjunction with the Rule Engine to apply business logic and rules for remediation actions.
- **Reporting and Notifications**: Generates reports on actions taken and sends notifications to relevant stakeholders about the changes made.

## Usage

To utilize the Auto Remediate module, ensure that it is properly configured with the necessary permissions to access and modify cloud resources. The module can be triggered based on specific events or run on a scheduled basis.

## Configuration

Configuration settings for the Auto Remediate module can be found in the configuration files located in the `infra` directory. Adjust these settings according to your cloud environment and organizational policies.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional cloud providers.
- Enhanced machine learning models for better detection and remediation strategies.
- User interface for monitoring and managing auto-remediation actions.

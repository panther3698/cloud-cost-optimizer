# Rule Engine Module

The Rule Engine is a critical component of the cloud cost optimization platform. It is responsible for defining, managing, and executing rules that help optimize cloud resource usage and costs. 

## Overview

The Rule Engine allows users to create custom rules based on various parameters such as usage patterns, cost thresholds, and resource performance metrics. These rules can trigger actions automatically, enabling proactive cost management.

## Key Features

- **Rule Definition**: Users can define rules using a simple syntax that specifies conditions and actions.
- **Execution Engine**: The engine evaluates rules against real-time data to determine if any actions need to be taken.
- **Integration**: The Rule Engine integrates seamlessly with other modules, such as the Notification Center and Auto Remediate, to provide a comprehensive cost optimization solution.

## Usage

To use the Rule Engine, follow these steps:

1. Define your rules in the specified format.
2. Deploy the rules to the engine.
3. Monitor the execution and outcomes through the reporting module.

## Conclusion

The Rule Engine is essential for automating cost optimization strategies, allowing organizations to manage their cloud expenses effectively. For more detailed information on how to define and manage rules, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

# README.md for the API Module

## Overview

The API module serves as the backbone of the cloud cost optimization platform, providing a set of endpoints that facilitate communication between the frontend application and the backend services. This module is designed to handle requests related to cloud cost data, optimization strategies, and user notifications.

## Endpoints

### 1. **GET /api/costs**
   - **Description**: Retrieves the current cloud costs for the user.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns a JSON object containing cost data.
     - **404 Not Found**: If no cost data is available.

### 2. **POST /api/optimize**
   - **Description**: Initiates the optimization process based on user-defined parameters.
   - **Request Body**:
     - JSON object containing optimization criteria.
   - **Response**:
     - **202 Accepted**: Returns a job ID for tracking the optimization process.
     - **400 Bad Request**: If the request body is invalid.

### 3. **GET /api/notifications**
   - **Description**: Fetches notifications related to cost optimization.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**: Returns a list of notifications.
     - **204 No Content**: If there are no notifications.

## Request/Response Formats

All API requests and responses are formatted in JSON. Ensure that the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` for requests.

## Authentication

The API uses token-based authentication. Clients must include a valid token in the `Authorization` header for all requests. Tokens can be obtained through the authentication endpoint.

## Conclusion

This API module is crucial for enabling seamless interaction between the user interface and the backend logic of the cloud cost optimization platform. For further details on specific endpoints or to report issues, please refer to the main documentation or contact the development team.

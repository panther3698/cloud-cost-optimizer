# Machine Learning Models Module

This directory contains the implementation and documentation for the various machine learning models used in the cloud cost optimization platform. 

## Overview

The machine learning models are designed to analyze cloud usage data and predict cost optimization opportunities. This module includes different types of models, each tailored for specific tasks such as anomaly detection, cost forecasting, and usage pattern recognition.

## Contents

- **Model Architectures**: Detailed descriptions of the architectures used for each model, including any relevant diagrams or flowcharts.
- **Training Procedures**: Instructions on how to train the models, including data requirements, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Information on how to evaluate the performance of the models, including the metrics used and the expected outcomes.
- **Deployment Strategies**: Guidelines for deploying the models into production, including integration with other modules and monitoring practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the machine learning models, please refer to the specific model documentation provided in this directory. Each model will have its own README file detailing its unique aspects and usage instructions.

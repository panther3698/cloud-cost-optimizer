# Machine Learning Engine

The Machine Learning Engine (ML Engine) is a crucial component of the Cloud Cost Optimization Platform. It is responsible for the development, training, evaluation, and deployment of machine learning models that analyze cloud usage patterns and predict potential cost savings.

## Overview

The ML Engine integrates various machine learning techniques to optimize cloud resource usage. It leverages historical data to train models that can forecast future usage and identify opportunities for cost reduction. The engine is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the incorporation of new models and algorithms as they become available.

## Key Features

- **Model Training**: The ML Engine supports the training of multiple machine learning models using historical cloud usage data.
- **Model Evaluation**: It provides tools for evaluating model performance, ensuring that only the most effective models are deployed.
- **Deployment Strategies**: The engine includes mechanisms for deploying models into production, allowing for real-time predictions and insights.

## Usage

To utilize the ML Engine, developers can interact with the API endpoints provided by the backend. This allows for seamless integration of machine learning capabilities into the overall cloud cost optimization workflow.

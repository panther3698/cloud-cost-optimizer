# README.md for Backend

## Overview

The backend of the Cloud Cost Optimization Platform is designed to handle all server-side operations, including data processing, API management, and integration with various modules. It serves as the backbone of the application, ensuring that data flows seamlessly between the frontend, data ingestion, machine learning, and other components.

## Architecture

The backend is structured into several key modules:

- **API**: This module exposes endpoints for the frontend and other services to interact with the backend. It handles requests, processes data, and returns responses in a structured format.

- **Data Ingestion**: Responsible for collecting data from various cloud providers (Azure and AWS) and ensuring that it is available for processing and analysis.

- **Machine Learning Engine**: This module is responsible for training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models that help in predicting and optimizing cloud costs.

- **Notification Center**: Manages the generation and delivery of notifications to users based on specific events or thresholds.

- **Auto Remediate**: Automatically identifies and resolves issues related to cloud resource usage, helping to optimize costs without manual intervention.

- **Rule Engine**: Defines and executes rules that guide the optimization processes, ensuring that the platform operates efficiently.

- **Reporting**: Generates reports and visualizations to provide insights into cloud usage and cost patterns.

- **Orchestration**: Manages the interactions between different modules, ensuring that they work together harmoniously.

- **KPI Mapper**: Tracks key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the optimization strategies.

## Getting Started

To set up the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
4. Configure the environment variables as needed.
5. Start the server and ensure that the API is accessible.

For detailed instructions on each module, refer to the respective README files located in their directories.

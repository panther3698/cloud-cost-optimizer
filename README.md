# Cloud Cost Optimizer

Welcome to the Cloud Cost Optimizer project! This platform is designed to help organizations optimize their cloud spending by providing tools for data ingestion, machine learning, notifications, and automated remediation.

## Overview

The Cloud Cost Optimizer consists of several modules that work together to analyze cloud usage, identify cost-saving opportunities, and automate responses to optimize expenses. Each module is designed to handle specific aspects of cloud cost management, ensuring a comprehensive approach to cost optimization.

## Modules

- **Backend**: The backend architecture supports the API and handles data processing and business logic.
- **Frontend**: The user interface for interacting with the platform, providing visualizations and controls for users.
- **Data Ingestion**: Collects data from various cloud providers (Azure and AWS) to feed into the optimization algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Engine**: Implements machine learning models to analyze data and predict cost-saving opportunities.
- **LLM Engine**: Utilizes large language models to enhance decision-making and provide insights.
- **Notification Center**: Manages notifications to keep users informed about important events and actions.
- **Auto Remediate**: Automatically identifies and resolves issues to prevent unnecessary costs.
- **Rule Engine**: Defines and executes rules that guide the optimization process.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports and visualizations to help users understand their cloud spending.
- **Orchestration**: Manages interactions between different components of the platform.
- **KPI Mapper**: Tracks key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of cost optimization efforts.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the setup and configuration of cloud resources.
- **Documentation**: Central hub for all project-related documentation and guides.
- **Tests**: Contains the testing framework and strategies to ensure the reliability of the platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cloud Cost Optimizer, please refer to the individual module READMEs for detailed instructions on setup, usage, and development. Each module is designed to be modular and can be developed and tested independently.

## Frontend UI

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Running the Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
